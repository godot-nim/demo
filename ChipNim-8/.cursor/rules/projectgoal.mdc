@chip8.nim

[opcodes.nim](mdc:chip8/opcodes.nim)

The main goal of our project is to integrate a Chip-8 emulator programmed in Nim into the Godot Engine.
The way the project works is we will embed the emulator into Godot by rendering it in a SubViewport.

The tech stack used uses Nim, Godot Engine and a GDExtension called godot-nim, for which documentation will be provided.
A GDExtension serves as a bridge between Godot Engine and a foreign language, like C or, in this case Nim.

This means we WON'T use GDScript at all. All code must be written in Nim using godot-nim or gdext classes.


The final resulting program will use Godot Engine as a kind of UI engine to then create a UI around the Emulator for loading ROMs and displaying debugging information like the state of the emulator.
