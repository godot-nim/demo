# "Dodge the Creeps! 2D" with godot-nim

# How to Run

```console
demo/dodge_the_creeps_2d$ nimble build
```

And then **dodge_the_creeps_2d** will be created in **lib/**.

> **First time build only**
>
> Then run the following to create the project data (**.godot/**).
>
> ```console
> demo/dodge_the_creeps_2d$ godot --editor
> ```
>
> At this point, an error message stating that initialization of the extension has failed will be output. This is a bug, but not a problem. Reloading or closing the project will resolve it.

Finally, execute `godot` to play the game!

```console
demo/dodge_the_creeps_2d$ godot
```
